# Legislative Decision-Making and the Availability Heuristic
**(MA Thesis Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of UChicago MAPSS-Econ Requirements)**

This repository contains all code and data generated for my MA thesis project examining the impact of availability on legislative decision-making. 

### Raw Legislation Data
Legislation data downloaded from NCSL can be found [here for environmental legislation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GHiutv3FSdHzsZCFZUTeIJZ-5ISjtQMP?usp=sharing), and [here for juvenile justice legislation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1esZd_LXSc0MzOuAMdcLtDOaI56CgLhwj?usp=sharing) used for placebo tests.


### File Reading
Datasets are stored in CSV, RDS, or qs. The latter two can be accessed in R, with .qs files requiring the installation of the "qs" package, for which more information can be found [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/qs/versions/0.12).
